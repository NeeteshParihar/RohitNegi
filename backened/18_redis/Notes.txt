<--------------- Redis ------------------> 
1. in memory database , use to store non-permament data like recent search document 
2. the redis also keeps the copy of its memory data in the secondry storage , so in case of power cut it can backup the data.
3. for logout the accesstoken if not became invalid , then the request can be carry-out using that token 
so we have to store the accesstoken , so that we can block it until it expires , after expiration wee can delete it from redis. 

4. we can use redis in our system as well as in remote computer or server , the second option is scalable so wee will preffer this one.
